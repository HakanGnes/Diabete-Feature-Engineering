# Diabete Feature Engineering

## Problem: It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes or not when their characteristics are specified. 
You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

## Dataset Story:
It is part of a large data set held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the US. 
Data used for diabetes research conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in the city of Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona in the USA. 
It consists of 768 observations and 8 numerical independent variables. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result, and 0 indicates a negative diabetes test result.

## Variables:
Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies

Glucose: Glucose

BloodPressure: Blood pressure (Diastolic)

SkinThickness: Skin Thickness

Insulin: Insulin.

BMI: Body mass index.

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that calculates our probability of having diabetes based on people in our ancestry.
